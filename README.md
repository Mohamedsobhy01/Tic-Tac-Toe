# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Tkinter. The player competes against the computer, which uses simple logic to block or win when possible. The game includes score tracking, round resetting, winner highlighting, and a clean interactive interface. Great example of GUI and game logic in Python.
